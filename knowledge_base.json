Server issues can cause email delivery problems.<br/><br/>4. Email Configuration Settings:<br/>Confirm that the email configuration settings in the application are accurate.

    "question": "What are the leave entitlement methods?",
    "answer": "Different leave types are associated with distinct earning methods. Each leave category follows its own specific accrual or allocation process. The most common earn methods are Earn Leave Basis and Entire Leave Entitlement. Here's what it means:<br/><br/>Earn Leave Basis: You earn leave days based on your length of service or the number of days worked. As you continue to work for the company, you accumulate leave days over time. The more you work, the more leave days you earn. Your leave balance is updated periodically (e.g., monthly or yearly) based on your service duration.<br/><br/>Entire Leave Entitlement: You receive your full annual leave allowance at the beginning of the leave year. This means you have your complete leave allocation available upfront, regardless of your length of service during the year. As you take leave throughout the year, your leave balance reduces accordingly until the start of the next leave year.<br/><br/>If you have any specific questions or need further assistance regarding your leave entitlement, feel free to ask.",

    "question": "why I have no leave entitlement?",
    "answer": "There could be several reasons why a user does not have leave entitlement. Some common reasons include:<br/><br/>  1. Probation Period: During the initial probation period of employment, employees may not be eligible for leave entitlement until they complete the probationary period.<br/><br/>  2. Part-Time Employment: Part-time employees may have a reduced leave entitlement compared to full-time employees, depending on their employment contract and company policies.<br/><br/>  3. Contractual Arrangements: Contract workers or freelancers may not have leave entitlements, as their employment is based on specific project or contract terms.<br/><br/>  4. Unpaid Leave (UPL): If an employee has exhausted their annual leave entitlement and takes additional leave without pay (Unpaid Leave), their leave balance may show as zero until the next leave year.<br/><br/>  5. Termination or Resignation: If an employee is in the process of resigning or their employment has been terminated, they may not have any remaining leave entitlement.<br/><br/>  6. New Hire: If an employee has recently joined the company, their leave entitlement may not be available until the start of the next leave year or after completing a certain period of service.<br/><br/>  7. Specific Leave Policies: Some companies may have specific leave policies that affect certain employees' entitlement based on factors such as job role, employment category, or company policy changes.  8. Errors or Data Issues: In some cases, discrepancies or data entry errors in the system may temporarily prevent employees from viewing their leave entitlement.  If an employee believes that they should have leave entitlement but do not see it in their record, they should contact their HR department to address the issue and obtain the correct information. The HR team can review the employee's employment status, contract terms, and leave records to determine the reason for the absence of leave entitlement.",

    "question": "Why I cannot apply for annual leave?",
    "answer": "If you are unable to apply for Annual Leave because it is not available in the selection list, there could be several reasons for this issue. Here are some common possibilities and troubleshooting steps:<br/><br/>1. Eligibility Criteria: Ensure that you are eligible to apply for Annual Leave based on the company's leave policy. Some companies may have specific criteria, such as completing a minimum service period or probation period, to be eligible for certain types of leave.<br/><br/>2. Leave Allocation: Check if the Annual Leave has been allocated to you for the current leave year. Some companies allocate leave days at the beginning of the year, and if you have exhausted your allocation, you may not see it in the selection list.<br/><br/>3.

    "question": "Why i cannot see and apply any overtime to leave application even though i had fulfill the minimum rate of overtime hours?",
    "answer": "If you are unable to apply for leave despite having earned leave, there could be several reasons for this issue. Here are some common possibilities and troubleshooting steps:<br/><br/>  1. Leave Application Window: Check if there is a specific application window or period during which employees are allowed to apply for leave. If you are trying to apply for leave outside of the designated window, the system may not allow it.<br/><br/>  2. Leave Type Availability: Verify that the specific leave type you are trying to apply for is available in the selection list. Some leave management systems may restrict certain leave types based on company policies or leave rules.<br/><br/>  3. Exhausted Leave Entitlement: Ensure that you have not exhausted your leave entitlement for the particular leave type you are trying to apply for. If you have already utilized all your earned leave days, the system may not permit you to apply for additional leave.<br/><br/>  4. Minimum Leave Duration: Check if there is a minimum leave duration requirement for the leave type you are trying to apply for. Some leave types may have a minimum number of days that need to be taken at once.<br/><br/>  5. Technical Issue: Look out for any technical issues with the leave management system or the application process. There might be a glitch or error that is preventing you from applying for leave.<br/><br/>  6. Company Policy Changes: Verify if there have been any recent changes to the company's leave policy that may impact leave entitlements or application procedures.<br/><br/>  7. Leave Quota Restrictions: Some organizations may impose restrictions on the number of employees who can take leave simultaneously, especially during peak business periods. It's possible that the leave quota for the desired time period has been reached.<br/><br/>  8. Approval Workflow: If your leave application requires approval from a higher authority (e.g., manager or supervisor), check if the approval process is delaying the application.<br/><br/>  If you have reviewed the above points and still cannot apply for leave, it is best to reach out to your HR department or administrator for further assistance. They can investigate the issue, verify your leave entitlements, and help resolve any technical problems that may be affecting the leave application process.",

    "question": "What is the difference between lump sum and day By day post method for leave payroll posting?",
    "answer": "In terms of payroll posting, \"lump sum\" and \"day by day\" are two different methods for recording and processing employee payments. These methods are often used to calculate and post various types of payments, such as leave encashment, salaries, wages, bonuses, and other compensations. Let's break down what each method means:<br/><br/>1. Lump Sum:<br/>The \"lump sum\" method involves posting the entire payment for a specific period or category as a single amount. This means that regardless of the specific days or hours worked, the entire payment is treated as a single sum for that period. Lump sum payments are usually used when the payment amount is fixed and doesn't depend on the exact hours or days worked. <br/><br/>Example: A monthly salary or an annual bonus could be processed using the lump sum method. If an employee receives a monthly salary of RM 5,000, regardless of the number of days worked in that month, the entire RM 5,000 is posted as a lump sum.<br/><br/>2. Day by Day:<br/>The \"day by day\" method involves calculating and posting payments based on the actual days or hours worked by an employee. Each day or hour worked is recorded individually, and the payment is calculated accordingly. This method is particularly useful when employees are paid based on their attendance and the actual time they spend working.<br/><br/>Example: If an employee's hourly wage is RM 20.00, and they work 8 hours on Monday and 6 hours on Tuesday, the \"day by day\" method would calculate their payment as (8 hours * RM 20.00) for Monday and (6 hours * RM 20.00) for Tuesday, resulting in a total payment of RM 200.00.<br/><br/>In summary, the \"lump sum\" method involves posting a fixed amount for a specified period regardless of actual hours or days worked, while the \"day by day\" method calculates payments based on the actual hours or days worked by an employee. The choice between these methods depends on the nature of the compensation, the type of work, and the company's payroll policies.",

    "question": "Any difference between Normal OT / overtime and Callback OT / overtime?",
    "answer": "There is a difference between Normal Overtime (OT) and Callback Overtime. Here's a brief explanation of each:<br/><br/>Normal Overtime: Normal OT refers to the extra hours an employee works beyond their regular scheduled working hours. It usually occurs when an employee is required to work additional hours beyond their standard daily or weekly working hours. Normal OT is often scheduled in advance or as part of a regular work pattern.<br/>Example: If an employee's regular working hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, and they work until 7:00 PM to complete a project, the two extra hours worked (from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM) would be considered Normal OT.<br/><br/>Callback Overtime: Callback OT refers to the extra hours an employee works when they are called back to work outside their regular working hours, typically during non-working hours or on a day off. It usually occurs in situations where an employee is urgently needed to address a work-related matter outside their normal working schedule.<br/>Example: If an employee receives a call outside their regular working hours to handle an emergency task or address a critical issue for the company, any hours worked during this callback period would be considered Callback OT.<br/><br/>It's important to note that the eligibility, rates, and policies for Normal OT and Callback OT may differ based on company guidelines, labor laws, and collective bargaining agreements.",

Planned OT: refer to overtime that an employee requests in advance and is typically pre-approved by the supervisor or manager. Employees may submit a request for Planned OT when they know in advance that they will need to work additional hours beyond their regular schedule. This type of OT is usually used for specific purposes, such as completing a project, meeting a deadline, or handling an urgent task. Employees need to provide details about the date, time, and reason for the overtime request during the application process.Example of Planned OT: An employee knows that they need to work late to finish a critical report, so they submit a Planned OT request for working two extra hours after their regular shift.<br/><br/>2. Auto OT: refer to overtime that is automatically calculated and generated by the system based on predefined rules and criteria. The system automatically identifies instances when an employee works beyond their scheduled hours, and it generates overtime hours accordingly. Auto OT is usually used for situations where employees work overtime unexpectedly or outside their regular shift due to operational requirements. Example of Auto OT: If an employee clocks in early or stays late due to a sudden increase in workload, the HR software automatically calculates the extra hours and generates Auto OT based on the predefined rules.<br/><br/>In summary, Planned OT is when an employee requests and gets approval for overtime in advance, while Auto OT is automatically generated by the system based on predefined criteria for unscheduled or unexpected overtime work.",

    "answer": "If the system is showing you as absent despite applying for leave or clocking in and out, there are several potential reasons for this discrepancy. Here are some common possibilities:<br/><br/>System is showing you as absent despite applying for leave:<br/>1. Leave Approval Pending: Your leave application may be pending approval, and until it is approved, the system might display your status as Absent.<br/>2. Incomplete or Denied Leave Application: If there are issues with your leave application, such as missing information or if the leave has been denied, the system might not recognize it, and your attendance status could appear as \"Absent.\"<br/>3. System Update Delay: There might be a delay in the system updating leave records, leading to a temporary mismatch between your actual leave status and the displayed attendance status.<br/>4. Incorrect Dates or Duration: Ensure that the dates and duration of your applied leave align with your absence. If there is a mismatch, it could result in your attendance status being inaccurately displayed as Absent.<br/><br/>System is indicating you as absent despite clocking in and out:<br/>1. Incomplete Clock-In/Out: Ensure that you are completing the clock-in and out process correctly. If the process is not finalized (e.g., not hitting the appropriate button or failing to register successfully), it may not be recorded in the system.<br/>2. Mismatched Records: Check for any mismatches between the recorded clock-in/out times and the scheduled working hours. Discrepancies can lead to inaccuracies in the attendance report.<br/>3. System Update Delay:Similar to the leave scenario, there might be a delay in the system updating attendance records, causing a temporary mismatch between your actual clock-in/out time and the displayed status.<br/><br/>If you find that the system shows you as absent despite applying for leave, it's crucial to promptly contact your HR department. They can investigate the issue, check the status of your leave application, and ensure that any discrepancies are addressed. Additionally, they can provide clarification on the leave approval process and help resolve any concerns related to your attendance status.",
